# adopt_pets


Are you longing for a pet but have a circumstance/schedule that prevents you from having one? 
Adopt a virtual pet! Anytime, anywhere you can feed, walk and play with your pet.
The best part is you don't have to clean up after them, or get scolded at by strangers if your pet does something bad.
